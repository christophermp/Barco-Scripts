# Barco-Scripts

A collection of BASH Scripts.

Attached is an example script that extracts a diagnostic package of the
projector via the communicator command line interface.
This can be adjusted to have "cs reboot" in it instead and then upload
it to cinecareweb and use the lightlease as an example.
